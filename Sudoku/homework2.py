def convexProgrammingExampleDetailed():
    # This is a trivial convex program to help with using cvxpy
    # We will use a simple least-sqaures problem to demonstrate some of the functionality.
    # These are of the form:

    # Matrices and vectors are represented as numpy arrays. There are several ways to create numpy arrays,
    # Here we will create and fill them directly.
    # First, here is a matrix (numpy array) with one value in it, the number 4
    A = np.array([4])  # Note that np.array() takes a list so the number 4 is in brackets

    # Here is a second matrix with one value in it, the number 1
    b = np.array([1])

    # Define 1 variable to solve for.
    x = cp.Variable(1)

    # We will define the cost that we wish to minimize as the squared value of Ax - b
    # Which in this case is: (4x-1)^2
    cost = cp.sum_squares(A * x - b)

    # Note that this is similar to the above example: cp.norm(x - A[ i,:] ,2)
    # Try it:
    # cost = cp.norm(A*x - b, 2)

    # We use the squared difference here for a few reasons, but for this assignment it is
    # important to remember that the solution works with any constraints you may have set,
    # which in this example none are explicitly set. If we wanted to minimize x for Ax - b without
    # squaring it, the optimal value would be -infinity!
    #   Try for yourself and use this instead:
    #       cost = A*x - b

    # Solution:
    # Because this is set up as solving a single equation, we can do it before hand:
    # From calculus, the minimum is found when the derivative is equal to 0
    # d/dx (4x - 1)^2 = 2(4x-1) = 0
    # 8x - 2 = 0
    # 8x = 2
    # x = 1/4

    prob = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(cost))
    prob.solve()

    # Print result.
    print 'The optimal value is', prob.value, '(NOTE: this is should be interpreted as being 0)'
    print 'The optimal x is'
    print x.value
    print 'What this says is that for minimizing (4x-1)^2, the optimal value of x is 0.25, which gives the optimal value (4(0.25) - 1)^2 = 0'
